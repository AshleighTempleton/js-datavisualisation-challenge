# js-datavisualisation-challenge
Javascript consolidation project BeCode



#### 1. handling of the DOM:

- [ ] I was able to find the right selector to do it.
- [ ] I was able to inject the graph in the right place on the page via javascript.
- [ ] I was able to retrieve the html data in a format adapted to my javascript code.

### 2. Request ajax/fetch:
- [ ] I was able to receive the answer from the remote server in json.
- [ ] Then, I was able to build a callback function to process this data.

### 3. Use of **third party libraries**:
- [ ] I was able to integrate the third-party library into my application.
- [ ] I used the documentation provided by the library.
- [ ] I was able to generate the 2 inline data graphs.
- [ ] I was able to generate the "remote data" graph.

### 4. Problem-solving:

- [ ] Syntactic rigor: I was able to translate the processes I imagined into javascript syntax.
- [ ] Logical thinking: Through iterations and trial and error, I was able to find a logical path that works to address the issues raised by the client's request. Specifically:
  - [ ] I was able to generate the 2 inline data graphs.
	- [ ]  I was able to generate the "remote data" graph.
  - [ ]  I was able to build a callback function to process remote data (received via ajax).
	- [ ]  I was able to make the realtime graph refresh in real time.
	- [ ]  I was able to display the detailed data when I hover the mouse.

### 5. Debugging:

  - [ ]  I use the console to understand what is happening and compare what I am trying to program with what the machine is doing.

### 6. Separation of concerns:

 - [ ]  If I disable javascript, the user experience is satisfactory, the user has access to data and content
 - [ ]  If I enable javascript, the tables are enhanced with an interactive graph.
